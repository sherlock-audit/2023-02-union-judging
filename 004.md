# Index mismatch on vouchers and vouchees might lead to invalid borrower-voucher-staker association

## Summary
In certain situation, we can have a wrong borrower-voucher-staker association on the smart contract `UserManager.sol`

## Vulnerability Detail
When `vouchers[borrower]` does contain only one element, which means borrower does only have one vouche, and the staker gave more than one vouche to borrowers, and so `vouchees[staker].length > 1` and `vouchees[staker][0].borrower != borrower`. Then as shown on loc https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-union/blob/main/union-v2-contracts/contracts/user/UserManager.sol#L604 the `vouchees[staker][0].voucherIndex` will be overwritten to 0, which might be the wrong value, because we are modifying the struct Vouchee associated to another borrower.

## Impact
The issue might impact the integrity of the contract by mismatching borrowers and stakers

## Tool used
vim
Manual Review

## Recommendation
We suggest to check the `vouchers[borrower]` length before writing to `vouchees` map.
