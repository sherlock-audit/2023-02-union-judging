# A compromised/malicious admin of Utoken can write off the debt for any borrower

## Summary
A compromised/malicious admin of Utoken can write off the debt for any borrower. This is because a compromised/malicious admin of Utoken can set a new malicious  ``userManager``, and then call from the ``userManager`` the function  ``debtWriteOff()`` to write debt off for any borrower.

## Vulnerability Detail
Let's show how a compromised/malicious admin of Utoken can write off the debt for any borrower:

1) The compromised/malicious admin can set a new malicious ``userManager`` by calling the following function:
[https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-union/blob/main/union-v2-contracts/contracts/market/UToken.sol#L292-L294](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-union/blob/main/union-v2-contracts/contracts/market/UToken.sol#L292-L294)

2) Then the malicious ``userManager`` can call the following function to write off debt for any borrower: 
[https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-union/blob/main/union-v2-contracts/contracts/market/UToken.sol#L688-L702](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-union/blob/main/union-v2-contracts/contracts/market/UToken.sol#L688-L702)

3) After that, the compromised/malicious admin can call the ``setUserManager()`` again to set ``userManager`` to its original value to avoid detection.

## Impact
Since a compromised/malicious admin can help himself or his accomplice to write off debt, one can just keep borrowing and write off debt until the debt ceiling is reached. Borrowers can steal funds from the pool with the help from the admin and potentially undetected.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
We should not allow the admin to change/upgrade important components of the protocol. Such upgrade needs to follow common proxy patterns and should follow a good protocol to make the changes.
