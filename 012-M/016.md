# There is still possibility of Unbounded Loop in `registerMember`

## Summary

## Vulnerability Detail

According to this issue https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-union-finance-judging/issues/77, which some kind of duplicate of this issue https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-union-finance-judging/issues/69, the unbounded operations still exist on `registerMember()` function inside `UserManager.sol`.

The update only fix the existing member in `updateTrust()` function, but for the `registerMember()` it only refactor the function (creating `_validateNewMember()`) without really limiting the newMember.

## Impact

The unbounded loop can consume all the gas and revert the transaction.

## Code Snippet

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-union/blob/main/union-v2-contracts/contracts/user/UserManager.sol#L1089-L1109

```solidity
File: UserManager.sol
1089:     function _validateNewMember(address newMember) internal {
1090:         if (stakers[newMember].isMember) revert NoExistingMember();
1091: 
1092:         uint256 count = 0;
1093:         uint256 vouchersLength = vouchers[newMember].length;
1094:         Vouch memory vouch;
1095:         Staker memory staker;
1096: 
1097:         // Loop through all the vouchers to count how many active vouches there
1098:         // are that are greater than 0. Vouch is the min of stake and trust
1099:         for (uint256 i = 0; i < vouchersLength; i++) {
1100:             vouch = vouchers[newMember][i];
1101:             staker = stakers[vouch.staker];
1102:             if (staker.stakedAmount > 0) count++;
1103:             if (count >= effectiveCount) break;
1104:         }
1105: 
1106:         if (count < effectiveCount) revert NotEnoughStakers();
1107: 
1108:         stakers[newMember].isMember = true;
1109:     }
```

## Recommendation

Following https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-union-finance-judging/issues/77 recommendation, "set a limit for the member to make sure a vouch cannot receive unlimited amount of vouch"
