# A borrower can inflate the frozenCoinAge of a staker indefinitely, and thus impacting his effectiveStaked and effectiveLocked and rewards, possibly ZERO REWARD.

## Summary
A borrower can inflate the frozenCoinAge of a staker indefinitely, and thus impacting his effectiveStaked and effectiveLocked and rewareds, possibly ZERO REWARD.


## Vulnerability Detail
First, we show how a borrower can inflate the ``frozenCoinAge`` of a staker indefinitely, then we show how that will impact the staker's ``effectiveStaked`` and ``effectiveLocked`` and rewards, possibly ZERO REWARD.

1) Each time a borrower calls the ``repayBorrow()``, it will call ``_repayBorrowFresh()``, which calls ``userManager.onRepayBorrow(borrower)`` (L637) to update  a staker's ``frozonCoinAge``.

[https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-union/blob/main/union-v2-contracts/contracts/market/UToken.sol#L587-L668](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-union/blob/main/union-v2-contracts/contracts/market/UToken.sol#L587-L668)

2) Unfortunately, the function ``userManager.onRepayBorrow(borrower)`` will increase a staker's ``frozenCoinAge`` using  the elapsed blocks since ``accountBorrows[borrower].lastRepay``. without updating ``lastRepay`` each time. This will allow the same period to contribute to the increasing of ``frozenCoinAge`` indefininitely,  as long as ``lastRepay`` is not changed. 

[https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-union/blob/main/union-v2-contracts/contracts/user/UserManager.sol#L999-L1015](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-union/blob/main/union-v2-contracts/contracts/user/UserManager.sol#L999-L1015)

3)  ``accountBorrows[borrower].lastRepay`` will never get updated unless the borrower repays all interests  or all principal:

```javascript
 if (getBorrowed(borrower) == 0) {
                // If the principal is now 0 we can reset the last repaid block to 0.
                // which indicates that the borrower has no outstanding loans.
                accountBorrows[borrower].lastRepay = 0;
            } else {
                // Save the current block number as last repaid
                accountBorrows[borrower].lastRepay = getBlockNumber();
            }

```

4) As a result, each time a borrower calls ``repayBorrow()``, ``accountBorrows[borrower].lastRepay``. If there is still due interest, then  ``accountBorrows[borrower].lastRepay`` will never get updated. ``userManager.onRepayBorrow(borrower)`` will increase ``frozenCoinAge`` using the same ``diff``, the elapsed blocks since ``accountBorrows[borrower].lastRepay``. 

5) An malicious borrower Bob can call ``repayBorrow(Bob, 1)`` repeatedly and inflate the ``frozenCoinAge`` of his stakers indefinitely. 

6) Suppose one of Bob's stakers, Alice, attempts to call ``withdrawRewards()`` to claim his rewards, he might receive ZERO or less rewards because his ``effectiveStaked`` and ``effectiveLocked`` will be reduced due to the miscalculation of  ``frozenCoinAge``. ``withdrawRewards()`` will call ``_getUserInfo()`` to retrieve a staker's ``effectiveStaked`` and ``effectiveLocked``, and then use it to calculate the rewards for the staker. 

```javascript
function withdrawRewards(address account, address token) external override whenNotPaused returns (uint256) {
        IUserManager userManager = _getUserManager(token);

        // Lookup account state from UserManager
        (UserManagerAccountState memory user, Info memory userInfo, uint256 pastBlocks) = _getUserInfo(
            userManager,
            account,
            token,
            0
        );

        // Lookup global state from UserManager
        uint256 globalTotalStaked = userManager.globalTotalStaked();

        uint256 amount = _calculateRewardsByBlocks(account, token, pastBlocks, userInfo, globalTotalStaked, user);

        // update the global states
        gInflationIndex = _getInflationIndexNew(globalTotalStaked, block.number - gLastUpdatedBlock);
        gLastUpdatedBlock = block.number;
        users[account][token].updatedBlock = block.number;
        users[account][token].inflationIndex = gInflationIndex;
        if (unionToken.balanceOf(address(this)) >= amount && amount > 0) {
            unionToken.safeTransfer(account, amount);
            users[account][token].accrued = 0;
            emit LogWithdrawRewards(account, amount);

            return amount;
        } else {
            users[account][token].accrued = amount;
            emit LogWithdrawRewards(account, 0);

            return 0;
        }
    }

 function _getUserInfo(
        IUserManager userManager,
        address account,
        address token,
        uint256 futureBlocks
    ) internal returns (UserManagerAccountState memory user, Info memory userInfo, uint256 pastBlocks) {
        userInfo = users[account][token];
        uint256 lastUpdatedBlock = userInfo.updatedBlock;
        if (block.number < lastUpdatedBlock) {
            lastUpdatedBlock = block.number;
        }

        pastBlocks = block.number - lastUpdatedBlock + futureBlocks;

        (user.effectiveStaked, user.effectiveLocked, user.isMember) = userManager.onWithdrawRewards(
            account,
            pastBlocks
        );
    }
```
7) ``_getUserInfo()`` calls  ``userManager.onWithdrawRewards``   to calculate ``effectiveStaked`` and ``effectiveLocked``:

```javascript
function _getUserInfo(
        IUserManager userManager,
        address account,
        address token,
        uint256 futureBlocks
    ) internal returns (UserManagerAccountState memory user, Info memory userInfo, uint256 pastBlocks) {
        userInfo = users[account][token];
        uint256 lastUpdatedBlock = userInfo.updatedBlock;
        if (block.number < lastUpdatedBlock) {
            lastUpdatedBlock = block.number;
        }

        pastBlocks = block.number - lastUpdatedBlock + futureBlocks;

        (user.effectiveStaked, user.effectiveLocked, user.isMember) = userManager.onWithdrawRewards(
            account,
            pastBlocks
        );
    }
```

8) ``userManager.onWithdrawRewards()`` calls ``_getEffectiveAmounts()`` to calculate ``effectiveStaked`` and ``effectiveLocked``:

```javascript
function onWithdrawRewards(address staker, uint256 pastBlocks)
        external
        returns (
            uint256 effectiveStaked,
            uint256 effectiveLocked,
            bool isMember
        )
    {
        if (address(comptroller) != msg.sender) revert AuthFailed();
        uint256 memberTotalFrozen = 0;
        (effectiveStaked, effectiveLocked, memberTotalFrozen) = _getEffectiveAmounts(staker, pastBlocks);
        stakers[staker].stakedCoinAge = 0;
        stakers[staker].lastUpdated = uint64(block.number);
        stakers[staker].lockedCoinAge = 0;
        frozenCoinAge[staker] = 0;
        getLastWithdrawRewards[staker] = block.number;

        uint256 memberFrozenBefore = memberFrozen[staker];
        if (memberFrozenBefore != memberTotalFrozen) {
            memberFrozen[staker] = memberTotalFrozen;
            totalFrozen = totalFrozen - memberFrozenBefore + memberTotalFrozen;
        }

        isMember = stakers[staker].isMember;
    }
```

9) ``_getEffectiveAmounts()`` to calculate ``effectiveStaked`` and ``effectiveLocked``. In L933 and L935, both values are reduced when ``frozenCoinAge`` is increased (L933 and L935). When attacker Bob keeps inflating Alice's ``frozenCoinAge``, both ``effectiveStaked`` and ``effectiveLocked`` are reduced. When ``frozenCoinAge`` is too big,  there might an underflow revert. If that happens, Alice's call to ``withdrawRewards()`` will revert and then she will receive ZERO rewards.

10) In summary, if Bob keeps calling ``repayBorrow(Bob, 1)`` and inflates ``frozenCoinAge[Alice]``, then Alice will receive less rewards or even zero rewards.
 
## Impact
A malicious borrows Bob cab keep calling ``repayBorrow(Bob, 1)`` and inflates his staker's ``frozenCoinAge[Alice]``, then Alice will receive less rewards or even zero rewards.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Make sure ``frozenCoinAge`` is modified properly, record when it is updated last time, avoiding keep accounting for ``frozenCoinAge`` for the same period by keeping track of when ``frozenCoiAge[staker]`` is lastly updated.
