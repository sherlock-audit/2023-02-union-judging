# A borrower can inflate the frozenCoinAge of a staker indefinitely, and thus impacting his effectiveStaked and effectiveLocked and rewards, possibly ZERO REWARD.

## Summary
A borrower can inflate the frozenCoinAge of a staker indefinitely, and thus impacting his effectiveStaked and effectiveLocked and rewareds, possibly ZERO REWARD.


## Vulnerability Detail
First, we show how a borrower can inflate the ``frozenCoinAge`` of a staker indefinitely, then we show how that will impact the staker's ``effectiveStaked`` and ``effectiveLocked`` and rewards, possibly ZERO REWARD.

1) Each time a borrower calls the ``repayBorrow()``, it will call ``_repayBorrowFresh()``, which calls ``userManager.onRepayBorrow(borrower)`` (L637) to update  a staker's ``frozonCoinAge``.

[https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-union/blob/main/union-v2-contracts/contracts/market/UToken.sol#L587-L668](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-union/blob/main/union-v2-contracts/contracts/market/UToken.sol#L587-L668)

2) Unfortunately, the function ``userManager.onRepayBorrow(borrower)`` will increase a staker's ``frozenCoinAge`` using  the elapsed blocks since ``accountBorrows[borrower].lastRepay``. 

[https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-union/blob/main/union-v2-contracts/contracts/user/UserManager.sol#L999-L1015](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-union/blob/main/union-v2-contracts/contracts/user/UserManager.sol#L999-L1015)

3)  ``accountBorrows[borrower].lastRepay`` will never get updated until the borrower repays all interests (set the the current block) or all principal (set to zero):

```javascript

 if (getBorrowed(borrower) == 0) {
                // If the principal is now 0 we can reset the last repaid block to 0.
                // which indicates that the borrower has no outstanding loans.
                accountBorrows[borrower].lastRepay = 0;
            } else {
                // Save the current block number as last repaid
                accountBorrows[borrower].lastRepay = getBlockNumber();
            }

```

4) As a result, each time a borrower calls the ``repayBorrow()``, as long as he does not pay off the interests, ``accountBorrows[borrower].lastRepay`` will remain the same, and then `userManager.onRepayBorrow(borrower)`` will keep getting called, which will increase ``frozenCoinAge``  indefinitely.
