# batchUpdateFrozenInfo() and onWithdrawRewards() could revert due to out of gas when the vouchees array size is large

## Summary

batchUpdateFrozenInfo() and onWithdrawRewards() could revert due to out of gas when the vouchees array size is large

## Vulnerability Detail

_getEffectiveAmounts() loops through the vouchees array.
```solidity
        uint256 voucheesLength = vouchees[stakerAddress].length;
        // Loop through all of the stakers vouchees sum their total
        // locked balance and sum their total currDefaultFrozenCoinAge
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < voucheesLength; i++) {
            // Get the vouchee record and look up the borrowers voucher record
            // to get the locked amount and lastUpdated block number
            Vouchee memory vouchee = vouchees[stakerAddress][i];
            Vouch memory vouch = vouchers[vouchee.borrower][vouchee.voucherIndex];
```

If the vouchees array size is too large, the whole function will revert. Functions that call _getEffectiveAmounts(), like batchUpdateFrozenInfo() and onWithdrawRewards() will not work because of gas limit. 

```solidity
    function setMaxVouchees(uint256 _maxVouchees) external onlyAdmin {
        maxVouchees = _maxVouchees;
        emit LogSetMaxVouchees(_maxVouchees);
```
Although there is a caveat to setMaxVouchees, admin will not be able to tell what is the optimum vouchee size before hitting the gas limit. By the time the vouchees array gets too large, it will be too late to reverse the process. 

## Impact

Functions that call _getEffectiveAmounts, like batchUpdateFrozenInfo() and onWithdrawRewards(), may not work because of gas limit.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Do operations up to a certain index and then do for others. Do not use for full length of array in single shot. This will make sure that even if the vouchees array gets too large, functions can still operate before admin rectifies the issue.
