# Attackers can call UToken.redeem() and drain the funds in assetManager

## Summary
Attackers can call ``UToken.redeem()`` and drain the funds in assetManager, taking advantage of the following vulnerability: due to round error, it is possible that  ``uTokenAmount = 0``; the ``redeem()``function does not check whether ``uTokenAmount = 0`` and will redeem the amount of ``underlyingAmount`` even when zero uTokens are burned. 

## Vulnerability Detail
Consider the following attack scenario:

1) Suppose ``exchangeRate = 1000 WAD``, that is each utoken exchanges for 1000 underlying tokens. 

2) Attacker B calls ``redeem(0, 999)``, then the else-part of the following code will get executed:
```javascript
 if (amountIn > 0) {
            // We calculate the exchange rate and the amount of underlying to be redeemed:
            // uTokenAmount = amountIn
            // underlyingAmount = amountIn x exchangeRateCurrent
            uTokenAmount = amountIn;
            underlyingAmount = (amountIn * exchangeRate) / WAD;
        } else {
            // We get the current exchange rate and calculate the amount to be redeemed:
            // uTokenAmount = amountOut / exchangeRate
            // underlyingAmount = amountOut
            uTokenAmount = (amountOut * WAD) / exchangeRate;
            underlyingAmount = amountOut;
        }
```
3) we have ``uTokenAmount = 999*WAD/1000WAD = 0``, and ``underlyingAmount = 999``.

4) Since ``redeeem()`` does not check whether ``uTokenAmount = 0`` and the function will proceed. When finished, the attacker will get 999 underlying tokens, but burned no utokens. He stole 999 underlying tokens.

5) The attacker can accomplish draining the ``assetManger`` by writing a malicious contract/function using a loop to run ``redeem(0, exchangeRate/WAD-1)`` multiple times (as long as not running of gas) and will be able to steal more funds in one SINGLE transaction.  Running this transaction a few times will drain ``assetManager`` easily.  This attack will be successful when ``exchangeRate/WAD-1 > 0``. Here we need to consider that ``exchangeRate`` might change due to the decreasing of ``totalReeemable``. So in each iteration, when we call ``redeem(0, exchangeRate/WAD-1)``, the second argument is recalculated. 

## Impact
An attacker can keep calling redeem() and drain the funds in ``assetManager``.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Revise ``redeem()`` so that it will revert when ``uTokenAmount = 0``.
