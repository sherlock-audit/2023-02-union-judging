# Denial of Service Vulnerability in function `updateTrust()`

## Summary

This report identifies a Denial of Service (DOS) vulnerability in the `updateTrust()` function that could allow an attacker to consume `maxVouchees` by repeatedly issuing new vouchers of amount 0 using a different member account.

## Vulnerability Detail

`updateTrust()` function allows for the creation of a trust between a staker and borrower, and each borrower can have multiple vouchers from different stakers. 

The main vulnerability is that this function allow 0 amount new vouch. This allows an attacker to repeatedly issue new vouches with amount 0 until they reach the maximum number of allowed vouchers (maxVouchers), blocking any other member from being able to create a vouch.

## Impact

Attacker can create up to `maxVouchees` vouches, completely blocking anyone else from vouching for a particular borrower.

```solidity=532
function updateTrust(address borrower, uint96 trustAmount) external onlyMember(msg.sender) whenNotPaused {
        address staker = msg.sender;
        if (borrower == staker) revert ErrorSelfVouching();

        // Check if this staker is already vouching for this borrower
        // If they are already vouching then update the existing vouch record
        // If this is a new vouch then insert a new Vouch record
        Index memory index = voucherIndexes[borrower][staker];
        if (index.isSet) {
            // Update existing record checking that the new trust amount is
            // not less than the amount of stake currently locked by the borrower
            Vouch storage vouch = vouchers[borrower][index.idx];
            if (trustAmount < vouch.locked) revert TrustAmountLtLocked();
            vouch.trust = trustAmount;
        } else {
            // If the member is overdue they cannot create new vouches they can
            // only update existing vouches
            if (uToken.checkIsOverdue(staker)) revert VouchWhenOverdue();

            // This is a new vouch so we need to check that the
            // member has not reached the max voucher limit
            uint256 voucheeIndex = vouchees[staker].length;
            if (voucheeIndex >= maxVouchees) revert MaxVouchees();

            // Get the new index that this vouch is going to be inserted at
            // Then update the voucher indexes for this borrower as well as
            // Adding the Vouch the the vouchers array for this staker
            uint256 voucherIndex = vouchers[borrower].length;
            if (voucherIndex >= maxVouchers) revert MaxVouchers();
            voucherIndexes[borrower][staker] = Index(true, voucherIndex.toUint128());
            vouchers[borrower].push(Vouch(staker, trustAmount, 0, 0));

            // Add the voucherIndex of this new vouch to the vouchees array for this
            // staker then update the voucheeIndexes with the voucheeIndex
            vouchees[staker].push(Vouchee(borrower, voucherIndex.toUint96()));
            voucheeIndexes[borrower][staker] = Index(true, voucheeIndex.toUint128());
        }

        emit LogUpdateTrust(staker, borrower, trustAmount);
    }
