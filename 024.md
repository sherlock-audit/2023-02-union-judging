# Market adapter removal corrupts withdraw sequence

## Summary

Withdraw sequence entry is being deleted in AssetManager's removeAdapter() using incorrect index, so the sequence array becomes corrupted and withdrawals can end up unavailable.

## Vulnerability Detail

`index` used for adapter removal is determined for `moneyMarkets` array, but applied to `withdrawSeq` as well, while in there indices do differ.

## Impact

As withdrawals logic are based on withdraw sequence array, the withdrawals can end up unavailable. For example, if 95% of the funds are held in a market, whose entry corresponded to the `index` removed, withdrawals will be frozen for an arbitrary time for the whole protocol until `withdrawSeq` be manually restored. 

## Code Snippet

removeAdapter() determines the `index` for `moneyMarkets` array:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-union/blob/main/union-v2-contracts/contracts/asset/AssetManager.sol#L435-L463

```solidity
    /**
     *  @dev Remove a adapter for the underlying lending protocol
     *  @param adapterAddress adapter address
     */
    function removeAdapter(address adapterAddress) external override onlyAdmin {
        bool isExist = false;
        uint256 index = 0;
        uint256 moneyMarketsLength = moneyMarkets.length;
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < moneyMarketsLength; i++) {
            if (adapterAddress == address(moneyMarkets[i])) {
                isExist = true;
                index = i;
                break;
            }
        }

        if (isExist) {
            for (uint256 i = 0; i < supportedTokensList.length; i++) {
                if (moneyMarkets[index].getSupply(supportedTokensList[i]) >= 10000) revert RemainingFunds(); //ignore the dust
            }
            moneyMarkets[index] = moneyMarkets[moneyMarketsLength - 1];
            moneyMarkets.pop();

            withdrawSeq[index] = withdrawSeq[withdrawSeq.length - 1];
            withdrawSeq.pop();

            _removeTokenApprovals(adapterAddress);
        }
    }
```

But `withdrawSeq` is a permutation of `moneyMarkets`, so their indices are independent and do not correspond to each other:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-union/blob/main/union-v2-contracts/contracts/asset/AssetManager.sol#L136-L143

```solidity
    /**
     *  @dev Set withdraw sequence
     *  @param newSeq priority sequence of money market indices to be used while withdrawing
     */
    function setWithdrawSequence(uint256[] calldata newSeq) external override onlyAdmin {
        if (newSeq.length != moneyMarkets.length) revert NotParity();
        withdrawSeq = newSeq;
    }
```

So `index` in `withdrawSeq` being deleted do not generally correspond to the adapter, i.e. some other market end up being removed:

https://github.com/unioncredit/union-v2-contracts/blob/49d1a7261a7be20fe77b91a8a73e3cba8bc5bda5/contracts/asset/AssetManager.sol#L464-L465

```solidity
            withdrawSeq[index] = withdrawSeq[withdrawSeq.length - 1];
            withdrawSeq.pop();
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Consider repeating the entry finding logic for `withdrawSeq`, for example:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-union/blob/main/union-v2-contracts/contracts/asset/AssetManager.sol#L435-L463

```solidity
    /**
     *  @dev Remove a adapter for the underlying lending protocol
     *  @param adapterAddress adapter address
     */
    function removeAdapter(address adapterAddress) external override onlyAdmin {
        bool isExist = false;
        uint256 index = 0;
+       uint256 indexSeq = 0;
        uint256 moneyMarketsLength = moneyMarkets.length;
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < moneyMarketsLength; i++) {
            if (adapterAddress == address(moneyMarkets[i])) {
                isExist = true;
                index = i;
                break;
            }
        }

        if (isExist) {
+           for (uint256 i = 0; i < moneyMarketsLength; i++) {
+               if (adapterAddress == address(withdrawSeq[i])) {
+                   indexSeq = i;
+                   break;
+               }
+           }

            for (uint256 i = 0; i < supportedTokensList.length; i++) {
                if (moneyMarkets[index].getSupply(supportedTokensList[i]) >= 10000) revert RemainingFunds(); //ignore the dust
            }
            moneyMarkets[index] = moneyMarkets[moneyMarketsLength - 1];
            moneyMarkets.pop();

-           withdrawSeq[index] = withdrawSeq[withdrawSeq.length - 1];
+           withdrawSeq[indexSeq] = withdrawSeq[withdrawSeq.length - 1];
            withdrawSeq.pop();

            _removeTokenApprovals(adapterAddress);
        }
    }
```
