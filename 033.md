# Reentrancy in Comptroller#withdrawRewards()

## Summary

There is a potential reentrancy in Comptroller#withdrawRewards().

## Vulnerability Detail

Compared to the previous version (whereby only the user manager can withdraw rewards) , withdrawRewards can now be called by any user to withdraw their rewards.

[Previous version](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-union-finance/blob/6aeeaeebdbb01712bcc38e4339e1f62f9f6193d3/union-v2-contracts/contracts/token/Comptroller.sol#L231-L236)
```solidity
    function withdrawRewards(address account, address token)
        external
        override
        whenNotPaused
        onlyUserManager(token)
        returns (uint256)
```

[Current Version](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-union/blob/main/union-v2-contracts/contracts/token/Comptroller.sol#L224-L227)

```solidity
    function withdrawRewards(address account, address token) external override whenNotPaused returns (uint256) {
        IUserManager userManager = _getUserManager(token);


        // Lookup account state from UserManager
```

When withdrawing rewards, unionTokens are transferred to the user first before updating the mapping.

```solidity
        if (unionToken.balanceOf(address(this)) >= amount && amount > 0) {
            unionToken.safeTransfer(account, amount);
            users[account][token].accrued = 0;
            emit LogWithdrawRewards(account, amount);


            return amount;
```

The code fails to check the CEI (checks, effects, interaction) pattern and since the function can be called by a user, the user can reenter the function and transfer the reward token before their users[account][token].accrued is changed to zero. 

```solidity
    function _calculateRewardsByBlocks(
        address account,
        address token,
        uint256 pastBlocks,
        Info memory userInfo,
        uint256 totalStaked,
        UserManagerAccountState memory user
    ) internal view returns (uint256) {
        uint256 startInflationIndex = users[account][token].inflationIndex;


        if (user.effectiveStaked == 0 || totalStaked == 0 || startInflationIndex == 0 || pastBlocks == 0) {
            return 0;
        }


        uint256 rewardMultiplier = _getRewardsMultiplier(user);


        uint256 curInflationIndex = _getInflationIndexNew(totalStaked, pastBlocks);


        if (curInflationIndex < startInflationIndex) revert InflationIndexTooSmall();


        return
            userInfo.accrued +
            (curInflationIndex - startInflationIndex).wadMul(user.effectiveStaked).wadMul(rewardMultiplier);
    }
```
Since _calculateRewardsByBlocks() still returns `userInfo.accrued`, which is not updated yet, user can reenter the contract and get more union tokens than intended.


## Impact

Withdraw more union tokens from stake than intended.

## Recommendation

Add a reentrancy guard to the function or comply to the CEI pattern.

```solidity
        if (unionToken.balanceOf(address(this)) >= amount && amount > 0) {
+         users[account][token].accrued = 0;
          unionToken.safeTransfer(account, amount);
-         users[account][token].accrued = 0;
            emit LogWithdrawRewards(account, amount);


            return amount;
```
