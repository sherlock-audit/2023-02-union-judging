# # [H-01] Asset Manager can deposit over the ceiling amount

## Summary

When depositing tokens to Asset Manager, the total deposit amount in the market could be over ceiling amount.

## Vulnerability Details

When depositing tokens to Asset Manager, there is no checking if the total deposited amount in the market is over ceiling or not. Therefore the total amount could be over ceiling amount. 

For example, following the stratey and risk assessment, the ceiling amount for the money market X is `100 ETH`. At the current time T, the total deposited amount is `99 ETH`. When a user deposits 1000 ETH, the asset manager will allow the deposit, the money market X ends up with `1099 ETH` which is way over the risk assessment.

## Impact
When the protocols and admin cannot control the maximum exposure to a money market. In case of the money market X has accident, the loss could be uncontrollable for users.

                if (supply + amount > ceiling) continue;
