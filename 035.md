# # [H-02] Debt can be written off when the contracts are paused.

## Summary
The debt can be written off by calling `debtWriteOff` function in `UserManager` contract even when the contract is paused. In that paused state, users cannot repay the borrows. When the pause period is long enough and leads to debt overdue, anyone could call debtWriteOff function and write off all the debts and leads to assets loss for the stakers.

## Vulnerability Details

When all the contract is paused, the debtWriteOff function could still be called by public if the following number of blocks pass: `block.number <= lastRepay + overdueBlocks + maxOverdueBlocks`

If the pause period is more than `overdueBlocks + maxOverdueBlocks` time, all the debt will be written off by anyone and leads to losses for the stakers.

## Impact

Assets of stakers are be lost because of debt written off.

## Recommendation

Add `whenNotPaused` modifier in the `debtWriteOff` function to freeze the state of protocol.
