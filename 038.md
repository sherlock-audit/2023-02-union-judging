# # [M-03] The Interest Rate Model with the borrow rate more than `BORROW_RATE_MAX_MANTISSA` can be accepted to the UToken contract.

## Summary

The Interest Rate Model with the borrow rate more than `BORROW_RATE_MAX_MANTISSA` can be accepted to the UToken contract. It leads to backdoor for setting larger borrow rate for users, and larger amount sent to reserve.

## Vulnerability Details

When setting interest rate model, the UToken contract does not check if the borrow rate of the interest model is more than `BORROW_RATE_MAX_MANTISSA` and accept the model.

## Impact

Borrowers will have higher interest rate than the commitments from the protocol.

## Tool used

Manual

## Recommendation

Add check in the `setInterestRateModel` function in UToken contract:

            uint256 borrowRateMantissa = interestRateModel.getBorrowRate();
            if (borrowRateMantissa > BORROW_RATE_MAX_MANTISSA) revert BorrowRateExceedLimit();
        
The same implementation could be seen in `setOriginationFee` and `setReserveFactor`.
