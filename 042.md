# Stakers with 0 locked amounts should not update their lockedCoinAge value

## Summary

Stakers with 0 locked amounts should not update their lockedCoinAge value

## Vulnerability Detail

In updatelocked(), if lockede == 0, the staker is skipped and the function checks the next staker locked amount. 

```solidity
                uint96 locked = vouch.locked;
                if (locked == 0) continue;
                innerAmount = _min(locked, remaining);
                // Update the stored locked values and last updated block
                stakers[vouch.staker].locked -= innerAmount;
```

However, the staker's lockedCoinAge is still updated even if it has 0 locked amount.

```solidity
            uint256 lastWithdrawRewards = getLastWithdrawRewards[vouch.staker];
            stakers[vouch.staker].lockedCoinAge +=
                (block.number - _max(lastWithdrawRewards, uint256(vouch.lastUpdated))) *
                uint256(vouch.locked);
```

## Impact

LockedCoinAge will be different.
