# Wrong implementation of Controller

## Summary

## Vulnerability Detail

[Controller](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-union/blob/main/union-v2-contracts/contracts/Controller.sol) is a abstract contract that intended to be inherited by concrete (actual) contracts, therefore. it's initializer function should not use the ```initializer``` modifier, instead, it should use ```onlyInitializing``` modifier. 

Otherwise, when the concrete contract's ```initializer``` function (with a initializer modifier) is calling Controller's initializer function, it will be mistok as reentered and so that it will be reverted.

See how ```Initializable``` is [implemented](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts-upgradeable/blob/master/contracts/proxy/utils/Initializable.sol).
See how an upgradeable util contract should [look](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts-upgradeable/blob/master/contracts/token/ERC20/ERC20Upgradeable.sol#L55-L62) like.

## Impact

```Controller.sol``` contract is inherited from following contracts:

* ```UToken.sol```
* ```UserManager.sol```
* ```AssetManager.sol```
* ```AaveV3Adapter.sol```
* ```PureTokenAdatper.sol```
* ```MarketRegistry.sol```
* ```Comptroller.sol```

Meaning that if ```Controller.sol``` is not upgradable, neither of them are upgradable.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Change the ```initializer``` modifier to ```onlyInitializing``` and function visibility to ```internal```

```diff
-    function __Controller_init(address admin_) public initializer {
+    function __Controller_init(address admin_) internal onlyInitializing {
         _paused = false;
         admin = admin_;
         __UUPSUpgradeable_init();
```
