# [MEDIUM] UToken.calculatingInterest() does not calcualte interest correctly, its result depends on how often it is called.

## Summary
``UToken.calcultingInterest()`` does not calculate interest correctly, its result depends on how often it is called. The main issue is that it uses a combination of Simple interest factor and then compounding interest. Therefore, the result of accrued interests depends on how often this function is called (called per block vs called after X blocks), and the calculated interests will be totally different. This should not be the case - the interests should only depend on the elapse of time.


## Vulnerability Detail
The ``UToken.accrueInterest()`` calculates the the interest with a combination of simple interest factor and compounding interest. Therefore, the result is different depending on how often ``accrueInterest``() is called and get ``borrowIndex`` updated. 

[https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-union/blob/main/union-v2-contracts/contracts/market/UToken.sol#L674-L686](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-union/blob/main/union-v2-contracts/contracts/market/UToken.sol#L674-L686)

Lets compare two cases: case A: For each block, ``accurueInterests()`` and then ``calculatingInterests()`` get called:  case B: after three blocks,  ``accurueInterests()`` and then ``calculatingInterests()`` get called. Suppose ``borrowRate = 0.001%`` (WAD = 100%), and initially ``borrowIndex = WAD``. Suppose ``principle = 1,000,000``.

Case A interest calculation: 
After one block: ``simpleInteresetFactor = 0.001%*1``, ``borrowIndexNew = (1+0.001%)``
After two blocks: ``simpleInteresetFactor = 0.001%*1``, ``borrowIndexNew = (1+0.001%)1+0.001%)``
After three blocks: ``simpleInteresetFactor = 0.001%*1``, ``borrowIndexNew = (1+0.001%)(1+0.001%)(1+0.001%)``.
so the total interest is ``1,000,000*(1+0.001%)(1+0.001%)(1+0.001%) - 1,000,000 = 30``

Case B interests calculation: 
After three blocks: ``simpleInteresetFactor = 0.001%*3``, ``borrowIndexNew = 1+0.003%``;
so the total interest is ``1,000,000*(1+0.001%) - 1,000,000 = 10``

The difference between them is: in the first case, we calculate the compound interest for each block, while in the second case, simple factor interest is used in the period between two calls of ``accureInterest()``, while from one call to another call of ``accureInterest()``, the compound interest is used. 


## Impact
In summary, if ``accureInterest()`` is called for each block, then a pure compound interest will be calculated, and if ``accureInterest()`` is called less often, then less interests will be charged due to the simple interest calculation between two calls. The result of interest calculation depends on how often ``accurInterest()`` is called.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
We should compounding interest for each block consistently. See below
```diff
function accrueInterest() public override returns (bool) {
        uint256 borrowRate = borrowRatePerBlock();
        uint256 currentBlockNumber = getBlockNumber();
        uint256 blockDelta = currentBlockNumber - accrualBlockNumber;

-        uint256 simpleInterestFactor = borrowRate * blockDelta;
-        uint256 borrowIndexNew = (simpleInterestFactor * borrowIndex) / WAD + borrowIndex;
+       uint256 borrorIndexNew = borrowIndex;
+          for(int i=0; i<blockDelta; i++){
+                   borrowIndexNew = borrowIndexNew*(1+borrowRate/WAD);
+          }

        accrualBlockNumber = currentBlockNumber;
        borrowIndex = borrowIndexNew;

        return true;
    }
function calculatingInterest(address account) public view override returns (uint256) {
        BorrowSnapshot memory loan = accountBorrows[account];

        if (loan.principal == 0) {
            return 0;
        }

        uint256 borrowRate = borrowRatePerBlock();
        uint256 currentBlockNumber = getBlockNumber();
        uint256 blockDelta = currentBlockNumber - accrualBlockNumber;
-       uint256 simpleInterestFactor = borrowRate * blockDelta;
-       uint256 borrowIndexNew = (simpleInterestFactor * borrowIndex) / WAD + borrowIndex;
+       uint256 borrorIndexNew = borrowIndex;
+          for(int i=0; i<blockDelta; i++){
+                   borrowIndexNew = borrowIndexNew*(1+borrowRate/WAD);
+          }
        uint256 principalTimesIndex = (loan.principal + loan.interest) * borrowIndexNew;
        uint256 balance = principalTimesIndex / loan.interestIndex;

        return balance - getBorrowed(account);
    }
```
