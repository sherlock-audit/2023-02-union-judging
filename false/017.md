# Low level call to non-existing contracts returns success

## Summary
Performing low-level calls without confirming contract’s existence could return success even though no function call was executed as documented in the link below:

https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.7/control-structures.html#error-handling-assert-require-revert-and-exceptions

## Vulnerability Detail
In OpOwner.sol, `execute()` performs a transfer with a low-level call without
confirming the contract’s existence of `target`.

## Impact
If `target` has not yet been deployed or has been destroyed (self-destructed), the call will act as if the assets (the native tokens in this case) were sent even though they were not.

## Code Snippet
[File: OpOwner.sol#L50-L59](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-union/blob/main/union-v2-contracts/contracts/OpOwner.sol#L50-L59)

```solidity
    function execute(
        address target,
        uint256 value,
        bytes calldata data
    ) public payable onlyAuth {
        (bool success, ) = target.call{value: value}(data);
        require(success, "underlying transaction reverted");

        emit CallExecuted(target, value, data);
    }
```
## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Consider:

1. checking the contract’s existence prior to the low-level call to ensure the call reverts if `target` no longer exists, or
2. avoiding low level calls.  If such a call is not avoidable, carefully review the [Solidity documentation](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/develop/control-structures.html#error-handling-assert-require-revert-and-exceptions), particularly the “Warnings” section.
