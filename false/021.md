# Debt can be payable when paused

## Summary
When paused, borrowers should be able to repay their debts.
## Vulnerability Detail
repayBorrow() and repayInterest() have whenNotPaused modifier. But when functions paused, borrowers should be able to pay their debt. It's unfair for borrowers to pay interest when functions are paused.
## Impact
Users might be forced to pay more interests
