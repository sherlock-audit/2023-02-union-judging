# Lack of 2 step ownership change for transferOwnership function.

## Summary
The `transferOwnership` function of the `OpOwner.sol` lacks 2 step ownership change and it can lead to irrecoverable error of setting a wrong address.
## Vulnerability Detail
File.
- [union-v2-contracts/contracts/OpOwner.sol#L42](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-union/blob/main/union-v2-contracts/contracts/OpOwner.sol#L42)
A wrong address can be mistakenly set as a new owner and it will not be recoverable due to the fact that the transferOwnership function does not have 2 step ownership change

```solidity
function transferOwnership(address newOwner) public onlyAuth {
        _owner = newOwner;
    }
```
```solidity
// transferOwnership with 2 steps from openzeppelin Ownable2step
function transferOwnership(address newOwner) public virtual override onlyOwner {
        _pendingOwner = newOwner;
        emit OwnershipTransferStarted(owner(), newOwner);
    }

    /**
     * @dev Transfers ownership of the contract to a new account (`newOwner`) and deletes any pending owner.
     * Internal function without access restriction.
     */
    function _transferOwnership(address newOwner) internal virtual override {
        delete _pendingOwner;
        super._transferOwnership(newOwner);
    }

    /**
     * @dev The new owner accepts the ownership transfer.
     */
    function acceptOwnership() public virtual {
        address sender = _msgSender();
        require(pendingOwner() == sender, "Ownable2Step: caller is not the new owner");
        _transferOwnership(sender);
    }
```
## Impact
The Ownership may be wrongly set and it will not be recoverable rendering all onlyOwner functions useless

## Recommendation
Consider using Openzeppelin's 2 step ownership change for critical address changes
