# Doesn't follow EIP2612 standard

## Summary
`userManager.sol#stakeWithPermit` are using eip 2612 permit for daiToken but it's doesn't follow standard of ERC2612 due to this it always failed and user can't able to stake with signature.  Currenct implementation is work for ethereum but it's work for other chain like optimisc, arbitrum.    

## Vulnerability Detail

As per ERC2612 standard permit function should be `permit(address,address,uint256,uint256,uint8,bytes32,bytes32) `. For more info please checkout https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2612.

```solidity
    function stakeWithPermit(
        uint256 amount,
        uint256 nonce,
        uint256 expiry,
        uint8 v,
        bytes32 r,
        bytes32 s
    ) external whenNotPaused {
        IDai erc20Token = IDai(stakingToken);
        erc20Token.permit(msg.sender, address(this), nonce, expiry, true, v, r, s);  //@audit Doesn't follow standard 

        stake(amount.toUint96());
    }
```

## Impact
User doesn't able to stake with permit functionality.
