# # [M-01] Cannot withdraw partially from asset manager when Pure Token Adapter is used.

## Summary

When Pure Token Adapter is used for the asset manager, user could not withdraw partially of the requested amount because PureTokenAdapter does not accept the logic and revert transaction.

## Vulnerability Details

When withdrawing from AssetManager which uses PureTokenAdapter, the withdraw function in the adapter use `token.safeTransfer` and will revert if the amount in the adapter is not sufficient.

The withdraw function in AssetManager is designed so that the withdrawal amount first was taken in Asset Manager, then the adapter. If the adapter has insufficient amount, user can withdraw partial amount.

However the withdraw does not work as design in this case because the PureTokenAdapter reverts the transaction.

## Impact

User could not doing the following operation with partial amount, the transacions will be reverted.

## Tool used

## Recommendation

In PureTokenAdapter, implementing the low level .call and check return false if the transaction failed instead of always return true.

The pattern will be the same as in AaveV3Adapter when using try-catch:
